[Ubidots](https://ubidots.com/) provides a secure and easy way to build IoT solutions for students, makers and researchers. It is used for sending data from any Internet-enabled device to the cloud, triggering actions and alerts based on that data, and visualizing it. 

<!--more-->

{{< warning >}} In this guide, we use the [UbiFunctions](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/2132086-analytics-ubifunctions-user-guide) module, which is currently not available for the STEM plan. {{</ warning >}}

## Prerequisites

1. A Ubidots user account with an upgraded plan.

## Setup Ubidots

Log in to your Ubidots account and find the **Devices** tab in the upper part of your dashboard. In its drop-down list, choose **Functions**.

When redirected to the **UbiFunctions** page, create a new function with the **Create Function** button.

On the left, give a **Name** to your function, select the **POST** method and choose **Python 3.6** for **Runtime**.

In this example, we will use the following Python function, which receives a JSON payload from {{% tts %}}, extracts the `decoded_payload`, and posts received data to Ubidots.

{{< note >}} To find your **Token**, click on your avatar in the upper right corner and select **API Credentials**. Be sure to use your **Token** and not your **API Key**. {{</ note >}}

```
import requests
import json
import time

BASE_URL = "https://industrial.api.ubidots.com"
TOKEN = "路路路路" # Enter a token here

def main(args):
    # Prining args from TTI
    print(f'[INFO] Args from TTI:\n {args}')

    # Parsing data
    payload = parse_tti_data(args)
    dev_label = tti_dev_eui(args)
    print(f'[INFO] Parsed data:\n {payload}')
    print(f'[INFO] TTI Dev_EUI data:\n {dev_label}')

    # Posting to Ubidots
    req = update_device(dev_label, payload, TOKEN)
    print(f'[INFO] Request to Ubidots Status code: {req.status_code}')
    print(f'[INFO] Request ti Ubidots JSON:\n {req.json()}')

    return {
        'status_code': req.status_code,
        'response_json': req.json()
    }


def parse_tti_data(data):
    return data['uplink_message']['decoded_payload']


def tti_dev_eui(data):
    return data['end_device_ids']['device_id']


def update_device(device, payload, token):
    """
    Updates device with payload
    """
    url = "{}/api/v1.6/devices/{}".format(BASE_URL, device)
    headers = {"X-Auth-Token": token, "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    req = create_request(url, headers, attempts=5, request_type="post", data=payload)
    return req


def create_request(url, headers, attempts, request_type, data=None):
    """
    Function to make a request to the server
    """
    request_func = getattr(requests, request_type)
    kwargs = {"url": url, "headers": headers}
    if request_type == "post" or request_type == "patch":
        kwargs["json"] = data
    try:
        req = request_func(**kwargs)
        status_code = req.status_code
        time.sleep(1)
        while status_code >= 400 and attempts < 5:
            req = request_func(**kwargs)
            status_code = req.status_code
            attempts += 1
            time.sleep(1)
        return req
    except Exception as e:
        print("[ERROR] There was an error with the request, details:")
        print(e)
        return None
```

After modifying the function code with your token, click the **Make it live** button. 

Your function will be assigned an **HTTPS Endpoint URL**. Copy this URL in order to use it later as a part of setup on {{% tts %}}. 

{{< figure src="creating-function.png" alt="Creating a UbiFunction" >}}

Your function is now ready to handle the conversion of the incoming messages from {{% tts %}}, from JSON format to the one that is compatible with Ubidots.

## Configure {{% tts %}}

Next step is to create a Webhook integration on {{% tts %}} by using the **Ubidots** [Webhook template]({{< ref "/integrations/webhooks/webhook-templates" >}}).

{{< note >}} Besides implementing the Webhook integration, you also need to create an uplink payload formatter in order to decode the uplink payload and set fields in the `decoded_payload` object of the uplink message. This is necessary to allow the Ubidots function to interpret the payload coming from {{% tts %}}. See [Payload Formatters]({{< ref "/integrations/payload-formatters" >}}) for a detailed info. {{</ note >}}

First, fill in the **Webhook ID** field.

Then enter your **Ubidots username** and provide your UbiFunction's name.

{{< note >}} The name of the UbiFunction needs to be modified to use lowercase and dashes only. For example, if the UbiFunction is named **Example Function**, enter `example-function` in the **UbiFunction name** field as shown in the image below. {{</ note >}}

{{< figure src="ubidots-webhook-creation.png" alt="Ubidots webhook" >}}

{{< note >}} To see the values of all parameters of the Ubidots integration, click on the integration after you created it with the Webhook template. {{</ note >}}

Once you have created the integration, navigate to **Devices** tab in Ubidots dashboard and select **Devices**. 

You should see your device listed, as it is automatically added when an uplink is received. Click the device to see variables and their latest values.
