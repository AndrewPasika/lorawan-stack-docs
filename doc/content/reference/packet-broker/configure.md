## Peering Between {{% tts %}} Cloud and The Things Network

By default, Packet Broker enables peering in the following scenario:

- Traffic received on The Things Network is forwarded to The Things Stack Cloud

Currently, Packet Broker does not peer by default between {{% tts %}} Cloud tenants, or forward traffic from {{% tts %}} Cloud to The Things Network. Cloud customers may file a support ticket to enable this feature, and it will be possible for users to configure {{% tts %}} to support peering from {{% tts %}} Cloud in an upcoming release.
