Device manufacturers may submit payload formatters designed to work with their devices. These are publicly available in {{% tts %}} [Device Repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices/tree/master).

If you're a device manufacturer and you'd like to add your device to the open source device repo, find out how [here](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices/blob/master/README.md). Adding your device makes it easy for users to use it with {{% tts %}}, and is a good way to publicly document information and code related to your device.
